1) We will use a live gold price editor app to edit prices for each variant. App link: https://apps.shopify.com/live-gold-price-editor
2) In that app we will add diamond price and gold weight etc. App also gives metafields do we want to show the details from that app in specific metafield
3) If some item have gemstone only then we want gemstone metafield to show
4) For example if a ring has no diamond, then the diamond metafield is hidden and it only shows gold details. We will tell you for which is what
5) Metafields change for each variation selected. for example if someone chooses big size ring and it has more gold, it shows more gold of tha metafield from price edito app.
